# Video Processing Using Python

This project focuses on video processing using Python, leveraging popular libraries like OpenCV and MoviePy. The tools provided here enable various tasks such as video editing, frame manipulation, and basic computer vision tasks.The "Video Processing Using Python" project is designed to facilitate various video manipulation tasks using Python programming and popular libraries such as OpenCV and MoviePy. This project provides a set of scripts and tools that enable users to edit videos, extract frames, and perform basic computer vision tasks on video data.

## Features

- **Video Editing**: Trim, concatenate, and manipulate videos.
- **Frame Extraction**: Extract frames from videos for further analysis.
- **Basic Computer Vision**: Apply computer vision algorithms to videos.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python (version 3.x recommended)
- Required Python libraries (install using `pip`):
  - `opencv-python`
  - `moviepy`

Install the dependencies using:

```bash
pip install opencv-python moviepy
```


## Examples

### 1. Basic Video Editing

```python
from moviepy.editor import VideoFileClip

# Load video
clip = VideoFileClip("input_video.mp4")

# Trim video from 5s to 10s
trimmed_clip = clip.subclip(5, 10)

# Save trimmed video
trimmed_clip.write_videofile("output_trimmed.mp4")
```

### 2. Frame Extraction

```python
import cv2

# Load video
cap = cv2.VideoCapture("input_video.mp4")

frame_count = 0

while cap.isOpened():
    ret, frame = cap.read()
    if not ret:
        break
    
    # Save frame
    cv2.imwrite(f"frame_{frame_count}.jpg", frame)
    frame_count += 1

cap.release()
```
